# 🧰 Tools Used – Phishing Email Identifier

This project uses open-source, browser-based tools commonly used by
SOC analysts during phishing email investigations.

## 🔧 Tools

### 🔍 VirusTotal
- Used for URL reputation and detection analysis
- Helped identify whether URLs were flagged as phishing or malicious
- Demonstrated limitations of reputation-based detection

### 🌐 MXToolbox
- Used for domain and DNS resolution analysis
- Identified inactive or non-resolving domains
- Helped detect short-lived phishing infrastructure

## 🧠 Analyst Note
Security tools provide indicators, not final verdicts.
Contextual analysis and analyst judgment are essential in phishing
detection.
