# 🛡️ SOC Cybersecurity Projects

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practical experience in cybersecurity, with a strong focus on **Security Operations Center (SOC)** and **Blue Team** operations.  
The projects are designed around real-world defensive security scenarios and common SOC responsibilities.

Through this portfolio, I demonstrate my understanding of security fundamentals, threat detection, log analysis, vulnerability management, incident investigation, and basic security automation, along with clear documentation and explanations.

## 📌 Projects Overview

1. **Password Policy Enforcer**  
   A script that checks password strength and enforces security rules to reduce the risk of weak authentication and brute-force attacks.

2. **Phishing Email Identifier**  
   Analysis of phishing email samples to identify red flags such as malicious links, spoofed domains, and social engineering techniques.

3. **SIEM Log Investigation**  
   Investigation of sample security logs using SIEM tools to identify suspicious activity and document findings from a SOC analyst perspective.

4. **Network Scanning & Enumeration (Nmap)**  
   Conducted network reconnaissance using Nmap to discover open ports, services, and versions, followed by attack surface analysis and security risk identification.
   
6. **Brute Force Detection Script**  
   A detection-focused script that flags repeated failed login attempts to identify potential brute-force attacks.

7. **Windows Event Viewer Investigation**  
   Analysis of a specific Windows Event ID to understand its relevance in security monitoring and incident detection.

8. **Secure My Laptop**  
   Hardening my personal system by enabling essential security controls and documenting the applied defensive measures.

9. **Basic Threat Report**  
   Research and simplified explanation of one malware or cyber attack, focusing on impact, behavior, and defensive understanding.

10. **Cybersecurity Portfolio Documentation**  
    Screenshots, summaries, and explanations that present my cybersecurity learning journey in a clear and professional manner.
